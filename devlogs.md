> I just finished making a very basic Readme.md file for the project. I'm about to start working on the new movement system this time I'm going to use predicates instead of scoreboards which should make it much faster then it was. After I learned that you can detect player input with predicates I've been meaning to do this. And this time I'm going to try to implement some sort of crawling system instead of just scaling the player down. I also just created this DevLogs.md file so the developers can rant about random stuff until they feel better about themselfs. I hate datapacks...

> Yesterday I commited an update to the movement system. It now uses predicates instead of the scoreboard system that I came up with before. I'm also planning to use advancements to trigger a function instead of the check_movement function that I have right now. I have removed the main namespace and moved the load function to the minecraft namespace. I have also added a `log` tag so we can log information if needed to help development of the datapack. Today I've renamed the DP-Grace dirctory to just Datapack because we plan to just have a .zip file you can just download. And we can just rename the .zip file.
