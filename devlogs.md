> I just finished making a very basic Readme.md file for the project. I'm about to start working on the new movement system this time I'm going to use predicates instead of scoreboards which should make it much faster then it was. After I learned that you can detect player input with predicates I've been meaning to do this. And this time I'm going to try to implement some sort of crawling system instead of just scaling the player down. I also just created this DevLogs.md file so the developers can rant about random stuff until they feel better about themselfs. I hate datapacks...
