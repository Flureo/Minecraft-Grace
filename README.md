## Minecraft Grace

> **Very Important!**
>
> **Please make sure that you support the actual developers of this amazing game** (no glaze) **and join the official Roblox Grace discord server [here](https://discord.com/invite/gracezone)! Thank you! ;)**

This in development project attempts to recreate a [**Roblox Grace**](https://grace-rbx.fandom.com/wiki/Grace_Wiki) *classic* like experience completely inside of vanilla Minecraft using datapacks. This can be challenging since everything has to be done server side **(So sorry in advance to the people with terrible ping)** and not being able to edit player data. There is also no vanilla way to add custom animations for the player*. These are only a few things that you can't do with datapacks. So you might be asking why use datapacks? Well, I like I already said it's vanilla which mean you don't have to install some sketchy mod. And it provides a bit of a challenge for us developers. But on a real note I have no idea why we chose datapacks. :skull:

> **Note:** This is a fan made project and we do not take credit for anything that has to do with the official game's development. And if you'd like to contact us for support please friend one of us on discord or make an issue report here on github. Please make sure not to bother the Roblox Grace developers with the issues from the Minecraft-Grace repo.
